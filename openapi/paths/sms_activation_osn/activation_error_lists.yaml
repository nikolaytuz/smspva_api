    # Important recommendations

    If you haven't received SMS within 580 seconds (9 minutes 40 seconds), make sure to ban the number you've got.

    If you ban the number when 10 minutes expired, the number you got won't be banned and might be given once again since the system keeps request ID in the base for 10 minute, after that ID is deleted from the base.

    Up to 40 connections are allowed per minute.

    Do interval of 4 - 5 seconds between any queries! Otherwise, you will not be able to fully use the API, because Your requests will be rejected by the server!.
